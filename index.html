            Welcome to my blog friends. I am Rosario but you can call me Rose. I am a Software Engineer with too many 
            hobbies that make my life more interesting and enjoyable. <br>
            Among my hobbies are dancing, singing, cleaning the house, reading, creating music 
            playlists, collecting Pinterest images, gardening, hiking, traveling to small towns, watch movies, cooking.
            But my favorites are: cooking, watch movies and reading. <br>
